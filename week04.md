## Week 4: System Requirements & Architecture

### System Requirements Development
- Analyze your top-level use case diagram to convert user needs into **system requirements** detailing what the software must achieve.

### Functional Requirements
- Expand system requirements into explicit functionalities your software will implement.
- Teams may divide requirements according to members' use cases.

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Address system type, user profiles, data handling, security, usability, and reliability.

### Quality Standards & Metrics
- Define quality benchmarks in line with your non-functional requirements (e.g., performance targets, security metrics).

### System Architecture
- Based on user access patterns, select an appropriate architecture (e.g., client-server, peer-to-peer).
- Justify your architecture with respect to project requirements.
