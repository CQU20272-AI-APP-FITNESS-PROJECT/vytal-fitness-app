## Week 3: Configuration Management & Git Version Control

### Key Concepts
- Understand configuration management terminology, including codelines, baselines, commits, and heads.
- Learn the essentials of version control, with a focus on **Git**.

### Git Workflow
1. **Repository Setup:**  
   - Initialize a Git repository in your project directory.
   - `.git` folder is created for tracking versions.

2. **Adding Files:**  
   - Use `git add .` to stage files for commit.

3. **Committing Changes:**  
   - Describe changes with meaningful messages.
   - Use `git commit -a` for tracked files.

4. **Viewing History:**  
   - `git log` shows previous commits.
   - `git status` and `git diff` help track and review local changes.

5. **Branching & Merging:**  
   - Branches help maintain different development efforts or features.
   - Commands: create, switch, and merge branches as required.

6. **Remote Repositories:**  
   - Use GitHub or other platforms for remote backups and collaboration.
   - Commands: `git fetch`, `git pull`, and `git push`.
   - Ensure your local changes are merged with remote updates to avoid conflicts.
